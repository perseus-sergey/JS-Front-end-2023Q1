Hello. My name is Sergey. I want to briefly tell about myself. I have never worked as a programmer, but all my life this activity is my main favorite hobby.

I tried to write my first small programs during the time of home computers in Sinclair Basic. I independently studied VBA from Microsoft Office, focusing on the databases of Microsoft Access and Excel.

With the Internet globalization, I became interested in web programming.
When I was engaged in the sale and installation of equipment for satellite television, I thought about creating my own visits site in order to differ favorably with my many competitors. I created my first several pages just on HTML and CSS. Then I wanted to add some functionality, so I plunged into the study of PHP and Java Script languages. Thus, my small site gradually grew into a large information site with MySQL database, with online television, television programs, an online store, self -noteworthy and self -acting content. I called it Installsat.TV. My site is still working, updated, sometimes requiring my minimum intervention.

A little later, I studied Java, Android, Swift, Python. All this was interesting and informative, but the wide prevalence and accessibility of the Internet suggests that it is web programming that currently allow access to the application on any device anywhere. And in my opinion, the Java Scrypt language is best suited for these purposes, allowing us to use the web application even in offline mode.

In addition to programming, my main hobbies are a trip, sports, photo and video shooting, as well as music, tasty food :)
Before the Russian attack on Ukraine, I lived in the beautiful Ukrainian city of Kremenchug, where I was born, studied, worked, created my family. For the sake of the safety of our children, we had to leave all our affairs and settle with my wife and children abroad.

I now want to associate my further activity with programming, because firstly this business brings me great pleasure, and secondly there is the opportunity to work remotely.
To keep up with the times, I realized that I needed to start the study of web programming more in -depth and structured. Some of my friends prompted me that there are very good training courses from the large well -known ITM company EPAM. Once on this courses, I realized that I made my choice correctly. I get a huge amount of necessary information in the correct sequence. The tasks are very competently and interesting.

I hope that the knowledge I received will subsequently bring people not a little benefit.
